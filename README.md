# `U3A` - USB/UART/UPDI - Adapter

The `U3A` project is based on a ([FT232](#additional-information)) that ist used as USB (Full Speed) to serial UART transceiver. Most signals of the ([FT232](#additional-information)) are routed to the connector pins `J2` and `J4`. Whithin the DIP switches the adapter can be switched from `UART` to `UPDI` mode to program microcontrollers. It is possible to select between two voltage sources. Either `5V` from USB or `3V3` from the internal LDO on the board.

> The LDO itself can drive around `800 mA`. Therefore it is necessary to install a cooling unit inside the housing. The mount for this is already provided in the housing.

# Hardware

There are two parts of the hardware. The pcb and the housing of the `U3A`. The pcb is created with [KiCAD](#additional-information) and the housing with `FreeCAD`. All files are built with `github actions` so that they are ready for a production environment. The housing is printed with a 3D-printer (`Dremel 3D40`).

## PCB

The circuit board is populated on both sides (Top, Bottom). The best way for soldering the `SMD` components is within a vapor phase soldering system and for the `THT` components with a standard soldering system.

### Top Layer

### Bottom Layer

## Mechanical

The housing has a tolerance of `0.2mm` on each side of the case. So the pcb should fit perfectly in the housing. The tolerance can be modified with `FreeCAD` in the `Parameter` Spreadsheet.

# Connection/Setup

The `U3A` is powerd over USB with `5V`. The voltage of the pins can be setup through jumper `J1`. Either `5V` or `3V3`. The output of the system is driven by `CBUS4`. It needs to be configured through [FT_PROG](#additional-information). Mostly pins of the IC are routed to the connectors `J2` and `J4`

## Simple loopback setup for testing purpose
